What are the types of React Components and what are pros and cons of each?

<details>
  <summary>Answer here</summary>
  The two types of React Components are Functional versus Stateful Class Components. Functional components are preferred if possible because of simplicity, however Stateful Class Components can be used to manage the state of a particular element if necessary. A recurrent example of a Stateful Class Component is with a Form, where the inputs should be managed by state.

How do we access props?

<details>
  <summary>Answer here</summary>
Props are properties passed down from the parent component. Within a functional component, props are accessed directly with the argument props, or destructured keys of props. Within a stateful class component props are accessed with this.props (after a constructor is built with props as an arguement and super(props){} is within that constructor)
